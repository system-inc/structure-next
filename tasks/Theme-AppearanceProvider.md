Refactor `ThemeProvider` → `AppearanceProvider` throughout codebase - Rename file: `structure/source/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` → `AppearanceProvider.tsx` - Update all imports across codebase - Rename atoms: `themeAtom` → `appearanceAtom`, etc. - Rename hooks: `useTheme` → `useAppearance` - Update Providers.tsx to use AppearanceProvider - Clearer separation: Appearance (light/dark) vs ComponentTheme (styling) - Prevents naming confusion between the two providers
